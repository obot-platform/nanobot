# Nanobot - Build MCP Agents

Nanobot enables building agents with MCP and MCP-UI by providing a flexible MCP host.
While existing applications like VSCode, Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Goose all include an MCP host,
Nanobot is designed to be a standalone, open-source MCP host that can be easily deployed or integrated into
your applications. You can use Nanobot to create your own dedicated MCP and MCP-UI powered chatbot.

## What is an MCP Host?

An [MCP host](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/architecture/index#host) is
the service that combines MCP servers with an LLM and context to present an agent experience to a
consumer. The primary experience today is a chat interface, but it can be many other interfaces such
as voice, SMS, e-mail, AR/VR, Slack, MCP, or any other interface that can be used to interact with
an agent.

## Examples

Here are some examples of Nanobots in action:
- [Blackjack Game](https://blackjack.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/blackjack.yaml) [(mcp source)](https://github.com/nanobot-ai/blackjack)
- [Hugging Face MCP](https://huggingface.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/huggingface.yaml)
- [Shopping/Shopify](https://shopping.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/shopping.yaml)

## Installation

Nanobot can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install obot-platform/tap/nanobot
```

This will give you the `nanobot` CLI, which you can use to run and manage your MCP host.

---

## Getting Started

---

## Configuration

Nanobot supports two configuration formats:

1. **Single File Configuration** - A `nanobot.yaml` file
2. **Directory-Based Configuration** - A directory with `.md` agent files

### Single File Configuration

Nanobot supports the following providers:

- **OpenAI** (e.g. `gpt-4`)
- **Anthropic** (e.g. `claude-3`)

To use them, set the corresponding API key:

```bash
# For OpenAI models
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For Anthropic models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Nanobot automatically selects the correct provider based on the model specified.

---

Create a configuration file (e.g. `nanobot.yaml`) that defines your agents and MCP servers.

**Example:**

```yaml
agents:
  dealer:
    name: Blackjack Dealer
    model: gpt-4.1
    mcpServers: blackjackmcp

mcpServers:
  blackjackmcp:
    url: https://blackjack.nanobot.ai/mcp
```

Start Nanobot with:

```bash
nanobot run ./nanobot.yaml
```

Nanobot serves MCP over HTTP at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Connect it to an MCP-compatible host such as Obot to interact with the agent.

### Directory-Based Configuration

You can organize your configuration as a directory with a top-level `nanobot.yaml` for shared settings and individual `.md` files for each agent.

**Directory Structure:**

```
my-config/
├── nanobot.yaml         # Shared config: mcpServers, llmProviders, env, etc.
└── agents/              # Agent definitions directory
    ├── main.md          # Main agent (auto-set as entrypoint)
    └── helper.md        # Additional agent
```

**LLM Providers**

`openai`, `anthropic`, and `orcarouter` are built-in providers — set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY` and they work with no additional config. Use the `{provider}/{model}` format in the `model` field to select a provider. For OrcaRouter, model ids carry their own provider prefix, so the model field uses the `orcarouter/<provider>/<model>` format, e.g. `orcarouter/openai/gpt-4o`.

Additional providers (Azure, Bedrock, Ollama, etc.) can be configured in `nanobot.yaml` under `llmProviders`. 

Each entry specifies a `dialect` (the API protocol), credentials, and base URL. The `dialect` field accepts:

| Dialect | Description |
|---|---|
| `OpenAIResponses` | OpenAI Responses API (default) |
| `OpenAIChatCompletions` | OpenAI Chat Completions API |
| `AnthropicMessages` | Anthropic Messages API |
| `OpenResponses` | Generic OpenResponses-compatible endpoint |

<details>
<summary><strong>Example <code>llmProviders</code> config</strong></summary>

```yaml
llmProviders:
  # Built-in providers — shown here for reference or to override baseURL/headers
  openai:
    dialect: OpenAIResponses
    apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    baseURL: ${OPENAI_BASE_URL}  # optional, default: https://api.openai.com/v1

  anthropic:
    dialect: AnthropicMessages
    apiKey: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    baseURL: ${ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL}  # optional, default: https://api.anthropic.com/v1

  # OrcaRouter: 200+ models behind one OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Model ids
  # keep their own provider prefix, e.g. "orcarouter/openai/gpt-4o".
  orcarouter:
    dialect: OpenAIResponses
    apiKey: ${ORCAROUTER_API_KEY}
    baseURL: https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1

  # Custom providers pointing at any compatible endpoint
  azureOpenAI:
    dialect: OpenAIResponses
    apiKey: ${AZURE_API_KEY}
    baseURL: https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1

  azureAnthropic:
    dialect: AnthropicMessages
    apiKey: ${AZURE_ANTHROPIC_KEY}
    baseURL: https://<your-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1

  bedrockOpenAI:
    dialect: OpenAIResponses
    apiKey: ${BEDROCK_API_KEY}
    baseURL: https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/v1

  ollama:
    dialect: OpenResponses
    baseURL: http://localhost:11434/v1
```

</details>

**`nanobot.yaml`** defines shared resources available to all agents:

```yaml
llmProviders:
  ollama:
    dialect: OpenResponses
    baseURL: http://localhost:11434/v1

mcpServers:
  store:
    url: https://example.com/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}
```

**Agent File Format (`agents/main.md`):**

```markdown
---
name: Shopping Assistant
model: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
mcpServers:
  - store
temperature: 0.7
---

You are a helpful shopping assistant.

Help users find products and answer their questions.
```

The YAML front-matter supports all agent configuration fields (model, name, mcpServers, tools, temperature, etc.), and the markdown body becomes the agent's instructions. Markdown agents take precedence over any agents defined in `nanobot.yaml` with the same name.

**Usage:**

```bash
nanobot run ./my-config/
```

The default config path is `.nanobot/`, so `nanobot run` with no arguments will use that directory if it exists.

**Features:**

- **Agent directory**: All agent `.md` files must be in the `agents/` subdirectory
- **Auto-entrypoint**: If `agents/main.md` exists, it's automatically set as the default agent
- **Markdown precedence**: Agents defined in `agents/*.md` override same-named agents in `nanobot.yaml`
- **README.md**: Automatically ignored in the `agents/` directory (use it for documentation)

> **Deprecated:** `mcp-servers.yaml` and `mcp-servers.json` are still supported for backwards compatibility but are deprecated. Define `mcpServers` in `nanobot.yaml` instead.

See the [directory-config example](./examples/directory-config/) for a complete working example.
